<p></p><pre><code>    &gt; I do think C# is by far the best mainstream language
</code></pre>
C# is a hugely underrated language that I feel like often gets overlooked when teams look to move beyond JS/TS.  The language has a pretty tight syntactic congruency to JS/TS[0], Entity Framework is pretty amazing in terms of DX/perf/maturity, and it seems like we should see more C#/.NET it in the wild than we actually do.<p>My sense is that there are some legitimate reasons to pick something like Kotlin (JVM ecosystem), but a lot of folks that might have worked with C# in passing in the .NET Framework days simply haven't given the ecosystem another look.  It's productive, stable, performant, and secure.</p><p>VS Code support is really good and Rider has a community license available.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://github.com/CharlieDigital/js-ts-csharp">https://github.com/CharlieDigital/js-ts-csharp</a></p>

It's much much more complicated than that. Sun refused to add many language features that Microsoft (then a cautious but also genuine user of Java) wanted.

C# having struct and class keywords, allowing you to define your own value types, is clearly a result of that missing in Java, which still in 2025 has no such equivalent yet.</p><p>Also Java's then native code interop solution, JNI, was and still remains complete garbage, and it's flaws were a huge guide for Microsoft when they deveoped .NET and it's native interop equivalent, PI (platform invoke).</p><p>Thankfully, Java now have FFM [foreign function and memory APIs](<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/foreign-function-and-memory-api.html" rel="nofollow">https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/core/foreign-funct...</a>) APIs (and also JNA which is community driven), which are much better than JNI.</p>
